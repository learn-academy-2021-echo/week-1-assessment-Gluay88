# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a software, a version control that can track and look at your codes like a time machine. It's created by Linux.
  GitHub is a code hosting online platform for version control (git).

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: loose equality operator (==) and strict equality operator (===)

  Researched answer: Equality operators compare one value to the other and judge if the values equate to the same thing. If they do equate to the same a Boolean value of true is returned if not we get a Boolean value of false. There are two types of equality operators, the loose equality operator and the strict equality operator. The loose equality operator converts the two items to the same data type before making a comparison and the strict equality operator requires the two items being compared must be the same data type to return true.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index is the value's location/position an array.
  value is contains elements/items inside an array

  Researched answer: index is the location of an item in an array and An array value is a structure that contains an ordered collection of elements.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: It preforms an action a number of times until a condition is met. It will be found in loops

  Researched answer: iteration is the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. A common form of iteration is called a for loop. A for loop defines a variable and increments or decrements the variable on each iteration.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is navigating how to code and another is coding along. They both have to think and share the ideas and solutions solving the tasks. They can take turn if needed.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programing has been very helpful. Having 3 people working on a project was fun for me.
  It was interesting how everybody contribute and try to solve the problems together.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request:
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

2. Higher Order Functions:

In Javascript, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way that strings or arrays can. They can be passed into other functions as parameters or returned from them as well. A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

3. Jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte.

4. Objects:
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

5. Classes:
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
